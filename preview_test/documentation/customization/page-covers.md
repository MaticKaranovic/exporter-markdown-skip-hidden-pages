## Show or hide cover text

Cover text (page title and description) are visible by default. To hide cover text completely, if for example your cover background contains text already:

> *Note ->* This change will only appear in the published documentation

## Show or hide sidebar

The navigation sidebar is visible by default. If you would like to create a landing page for your documentation, you can optionally hide the sidebar on this page.

1. In *Cover settings*, set the `*Show sidebar*`* *option to *OFF*

> *Note ->* This change will only appear in the published documentation
