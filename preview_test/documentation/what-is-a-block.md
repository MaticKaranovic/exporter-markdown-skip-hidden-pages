# What is a block?

---

A block is any kind of content you add to the page, such as text, lists, quotes, dividers, or media. You can move blocks around on the page to reorder your information.

Supernova has a special set of powerful blocks for tokens and components that utilize your design system data in unique ways. Keep manual documentation editing to a minimum and have your content automatically stay up to date. And when you introduce custom blocks through documentation exporters, anything is possible!

# Types of blocks

The default documentation blocks available are _text**_, _media**_, and _token**_ blocks. There is also the possibility of creating powerful _custom**_ blocks that can do anything else you need for your company's documentation.
