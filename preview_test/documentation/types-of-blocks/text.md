Text can be edited the same as in any most other editing software programs. There are multiple types of styles that text blocks can have for different purposes.

# Text

Text blocks are created by simply typing in a new row in the documentation editor.

# Customization

How text blocks are styled in the published documentation is determined by the [documentation exporter](https://learn.supernova.io/latest/documentation/customization/documentation-exporters.html). 

See [*Custom properties*](https://learn.supernova.io/latest/documentation/customization/custom-properties.html) for more details.

> Compelling, rich documentation sells design systems inside organizations, but requires a lot of effort to get off the ground. Supernova makes creation and ongoing maintenance dead easy so you can focus on improving your design system.

> Tab blocks can contain other blocks

Supernova manages the entire design system lifecycle in one place, without making your team change tools or maintain self-built workflows and integrations. Automate everything to fit the way you work already.
