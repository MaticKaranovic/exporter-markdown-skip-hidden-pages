### Brand assets

If you have brands enabled, you can switch between brands to show assets from a different brand in your design system.

- The asset block can display asset from one brand at a time

- Changing the brand will change the assets available in the token selection menu

- If there are already assets added when you change the brand, any assets without a matching or aliased asset in the second brand will be removed from the block
