# Overview

Automatically or manually get updates when changes 
are made in your Figma files

---

Supernova automatically checks for changes from your design system Figma files periodically. If you made an update in Figma and would like to check for changes immediately, or you have set your Figma file update mode to *Manual*, you can also fetch an update on demand.

### Last fetched version

The last fetched version is the Figma released version and when it was last published.

### Checked for updates

The checked for updates column is the last time Supernova checked for updates from Figma. If you have your file mode set to Automatic, this will happen in the background.

## Import summary

Your most recent import summary is also listed in *Design system files*, if you would like to review it again. If the update happened in the background, you can also review the latest changes here.
