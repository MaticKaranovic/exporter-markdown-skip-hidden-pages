Supernova gives you the freedom to create a design system that encompasses all brands of a company. In a Supernova design system, you can create brands that may share some similar tokens, components or assets, which which could be styled independently. 

With the documentation editor, you can access design system content from all brands and document them side by side in one website.

## Enable a multi-brand design system

Multi-brand design systems are enabled by default on the *Team* and *Company* plans. Every design system starts with a default brand, and *must have at least one brand*. This brand can be renamed if desired. 

If you have a design system already and would like to enable multi-brand, your existing design system content will become the first brand.

If your multi-brand design system has been disabled, you can re-enable it in design system settings.

## Branded documentation blocks

When brands are enabled, blocks that use information from your design system will have an extra selection option. Each token block can be changed to show information from a chosen brand.

If you switch between brands with tokens already selected, matching tokens will be kept in the block. Otherwise, if they don't have a corresponding match, they will be removed.
