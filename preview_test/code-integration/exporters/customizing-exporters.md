# Customizing exporters

Clone an existing exporter, or build your own custom exporter from scratch

---

All exporter packages are backed by _GitHub**_ repositories. This allows the exporter store to take advantage of all GitHub features like forking, distributing versions, or even provide a familiar place to report issues or feature requests directly to the author.

# Cloning exporters

If you would like to make your own edits to an existing public exporter in the exporter store, this can be done with cloning.

1. In *Code Integration → Store*, locate the exporter you would like to clone and click it to view the details

1. Click the `*GitHub Repository*` button to view it on GitHub

1. In GitHub, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository

1. _Optional**_ — if you would like to make this exporter public, you must [change the unique package identifier](https://developers.supernova.io/building-exporters/cloning-exporters#changing-unique-identifier)

1. In *Code Integration → Store*, click `*+ New*` and provide the URL of the forked repository

1. Click `*Confirm*`

The cloned exporter will now be available in your workspace.

# Building custom exporters

We recognize that everyone's requirements and coding standards are different, and that the file structure of the export can be vastly different from project to project — which is why we allow you to build your own custom exporters, and contribute to the community by publishing to the exporter store.

> Custom exporters are available on the *Team* and *Company* plans.
