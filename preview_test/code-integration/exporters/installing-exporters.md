How to install exporters in Supernova

---

In order to use an exporter, it must be installed in your workspace. The exporter will then be available to all developers with access to your workspace. There are two ways to install an exporter package: 

- install an existing exporter from the exporter Store

- link a GitHub repository containing an exporter package
