## Export design system elements to code

Export code for any platform that describes design system elements, such as tokens, components, themes, or documentation.

## Automatically distribute code

Seamlessly distribute design system code to any codebase with Supernova's _Design Continuous Deployment**_ (DCD).

## Fully control code generation and contributions

Code export can also be run manually and locally within your development environment — control what gets generated and how the code is contributed to the codebase.

## Support multiple platforms

Deliver code to multiple platforms at the same time.

## Build bleeding-edge code generation tools

Build code generation tools in a fraction of the time. Using our [Pulsar](https://developers.supernova.io/pulsar-language) technology, describe how the code generation should behave in regard to any codebase.
