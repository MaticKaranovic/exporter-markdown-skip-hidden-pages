Learn how to build, manage and maintain design systems in smarter ways

---

Supernova manages the entire design system lifecycle in one place, and is designed to fit with the way your team already works — without changing tools or maintaining self-built workflows and integrations. 

*Connect design files* to your design system that are automatically observed for published changes, and make all your design data available to everyone with a single click. Create advanced documentation using this data to *keep documentation in sync* whenever changes are made. Finally, *automate code delivery* with hooks to deliver tokens, styles, icons, components and documentation to your codebases.


Watch this short overview video to get better idea about all the things Supernova does for your design system:

## Design system management

> Maintain design truth for multiple teams and products

Connect your Supernova design system to your design files, which are automatically observed for published changes to keep your design system data up-to-date. With the Supernova token manager, maintain and extend design tokens with custom data, and distribute them to any destination, without having to create custom solutions.

## Documentation

> Build fully customizable documentation using your design system data

Start right away with a powerful editor that will be immediately familiar to users of writing tools like Notion or Google Docs, but with the added ability to embed dynamic data from your design system. Powerful documentation blocks can instantly render all kinds of content, and keep your documentation in sync whenever changes are made. Embed Storybook stories, Figma assets and styles, live code examples, and more.

With dynamic templates powering the documentation, Supernova allows you to customize every aspect of your documentation — from a documentation site that embodies your brand, to custom blocks that suit your unique requirements.

## Code & asset hand-off

> Deliver production code to all of your platforms

Automate the delivery of asset sets, style libraries and design tokens with Supernova's code and asset delivery features. Easily convert design data into code or assets with powerful, fully-customizable exporters for the most common platforms such as iOS, Android, React Web, React Native, and Flutter. Customize the delivery so it fits your needs and company standards.
