# Release #66

Tables, hardened security, docs publishing, better exporters and soooo many bugfixes!

---

_This version was released on April 29, 2022**_

With this version, *we have introduced table blocks *to make your documentation richer. You can also use table blocks for layouts, although we will be presenting a better option soon - stay tuned. We have also released additional security features, made manipulation with many aspects of documentation easier, added lot of conveniences and squashed a lot of annoying bugs, which will make using Supernova much easier going forward!

Last but not least, we are *continuing our efforts on making everything snappier and faster*, and you will see some fruits of our work already when visiting token / component / asset sections. Without further ado, here is what we are releasing for you today!

## New block - Tables!

We have added one of the most requested features to the editor â€” *Tables*! Simply write `/table` and a new, fully configurable table will appear. Here is how tables can look:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| *Components* | *Figma Designs* | *React Implementation* | *iOS Implementation* |  
| Button | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |  
| Textfield | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« |  
| Image View | âœ… | ðŸš« | ðŸš« |  


It is also possible to make tables which are much longer than the default size of the page. If the table extends beyond the border of the page, you can scroll it horizontally:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| *Components* | *Figma Designs* | *React Implementation* | *iOS Implementation* | *Accessibility Check* | *Version* |  
| Button | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | 1.1 |  
| Textfield | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸš« | âœ… | 1.3 |  
| Image View | âœ… | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | âœ… | 1.21 |  


Finally, tables can contain rich text content, including all possible formatting, and images - even combined together. More types of content will be available to you soon as well:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Design System Assets | *Static* | *Animated* |  
| *Mountains* | ![Img](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/6475/1d949b4c-4d95-48e5-a177-0ba5a5832556.webp?Expires=1972252800&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkaW8tYXNzZXRzLnN1cGVybm92YS5pby9kZXNpZ24tc3lzdGVtcy82NDc1LzFkOTQ5YjRjLTRkOTUtNDhlNS1hMTc3LTBiYTVhNTgzMjU1Ni53ZWJwIiwiQ29uZGl0aW9uIjp7IkRhdGVMZXNzVGhhbiI6eyJBV1M6RXBvY2hUaW1lIjoxOTcyMjUyODAwfX19XX0_&Signature=eJ1LTXLK7QxYO4x0vEjsju-EijBzpAEF68RMJg1cFii6tSPMOEXB47uxpr-P9ML84LvV23AGPK6PaDv6QTZ2qavr9SfJigFbi74XhCd5Z7akJBGYso19o0oPmIK5iw~3nkE8gBQQ3ejlfZ~LHV~krlbtrqxZVO1j91pcrB0cxfNC8LBILCf2FY-XQcIOmAOXIDNUkKNmVmSSwoI0LvRAIFHOovitvshQ-CdQEFgknEUxV9RHaMpO-I6tZ1r5uA7bDgDfuM3nt8Rd89iNZD07fk2q7YvfjRw5wiXrH6kVMP2-w01Hi6-EACA1Vcu2hnP-9s7BqIeU~1fVWnW06i6Qcg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJGK34LCCAUR7N6LA) | ![Img](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/6475/6317fe1e-70ea-4c28-88d5-9cd8cf2adbf6.gif?Expires=1972252800&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdHVkaW8tYXNzZXRzLnN1cGVybm92YS5pby9kZXNpZ24tc3lzdGVtcy82NDc1LzYzMTdmZTFlLTcwZWEtNGMyOC04OGQ1LTljZDhjZjJhZGJmNi5naWYiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE5NzIyNTI4MDB9fX1dfQ__&Signature=f40gMymf0caMmROm5V575n9FDY1JHhEzb1-0l~tA4srQtw8pyIUYoh6JbE6OtWNy5b9wbCQ2b9Ofq3PLl04BN1Zu03gu-LVSh3qOPr4zhMp7U86M949Tztc9gsvKboOeUavTu3u70B8xGz7UNyeO~YNnl65Q7rUFA9rcgPQyarAs3vhKCWoGDsuGsYjxbCdydtaxoARnik4HAzJ8eLRfP0MhzDH~E2n2yh4Fe~vu0pzb7ACj2wWv6MF3ZAhdMpUhx-k9-H7Q6fNmcrzP4lWd6n3ztTkIPSGDnyPMUcLD3KvoTlI-P~idqJpfbRhkg1mMb2gvOoB7~Su-SkUIoHr85g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJGK34LCCAUR7N6LA) |  


> Some extra info:  
> Some of you might find some visual table features you've asked for missing â€” for instance it is currently not possible to change tables visually and hide/show borders, but worry not â€” there is another batch of upgrades coming to it next week which will add more options! We just didn't want to keep people waiting for it any longer :)

## Hardened security - IP Whitelisting!

You can now enable IP whitelisting to fine-tune who has access to your workspace. If you have IP whitelisting turned on, and a user whose IP doesn't match the whitelist tries to access any page within your workspace, they are instead presented with the 403 (unauthorized) page. The workspace is still visible in the Workspace dropdown, but no other content from it can be accessed.

## Improved Exporter Packages

It is now possible to house multiple exporters in a single repository. You can also specify a subdirectory where the exporter is located within the repository. Additionally, you can now specify a branch of the repository as well.

We have done those improvements with teams that use more sophisticated setups, such as monorepo configuration with all ds-related tools in one repository. With this change, all situations and setups are covered.

## Private Exporters

Additionally to all the changes made to the exporter package system listed above, you can now also *fetch exporters from private GitHub repositories*. The installer of the packages will properly identify that you are not logged in and will give you the option to authenticate the repository.

## Public Docs switch

Team and Company plans are now able to switch between private and public docs directly in the settings. You no longer have to contact us to make your docs public - although we are grateful that so many of you did! Do note that *with Supernova, there is no limit on number of viewers* of your documentation!

## Documentation CTA

It is now possible to enable a documentation CTA button that can *link to any app / website / email you want*. This is really useful to send your users to a related site or app (like we do, in these docs!)
