With this version, *we have fixed quite a few annoying issues regarding documentation and made sure the users are not impacted by downgraded plan. * 

## Improvements

- If the content of the page is empty, the `Content` section in published Docs is not displayed anymore.

## *Bugfixes*

- We have resolved an issue when the Editor role accessing the editor in downgraded Workspace ran into `403` error.

- Header Row and Columns are properly highlighted in the published Docs now.

- Sidebar in published Docs is properly hidden when the `Show sidebar` option is switched off.

- Tables set as `Fit to page width` render properly sized in published Docs.

- Godot exporter generates the proper file structure even when exporting multiple Gradient token groups now.
