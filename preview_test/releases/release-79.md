# Release #79

Billing role, better component view, quick support view, improved docs copy paste & we also took antibug spray and showered Supernova with it.

---

_This version was released on July 28, 2022**_

With this version *we're bringing many long-requested improvements to Supernova.* Let's get to it!

## Introducing billing role

You've asked for it and the wait is finally over! Supernova now contains a new *Billing* role. This role counts as a viewer for all purposes except the ability to change billing-related information. This role doesn't consume a seat!

## Improved component columns

We've improved the system for component columns — you can now reorder all component columns except the name column, which will always float on top of the component view.

This is in preparation for many new things coming your way in terms of components (and possibly some other non-component views), stay tuned!

## New quick support view

We always want to make sure using Supernova isn't a struggle. We realize that an annoying bug will show up from time to time, or you might be able to find something you're looking for. 

But as we're onboarding dozens of new teams every week (insane!!) we're looking for new ways to make it easier to navigate Supernova and ways to give us feedback on things that need improving. Feedback is something we value highly, and we thank you for your continued contribution of questions and ideas — we're trying our best to keep up!

Today, we're introducing an in-built support system that you can find on the right bottom side of the editor screen. Click on it and you can talk with our support, quickly and easily!

## Improved documentation copy/paste

We've added the option to copy-paste new elements into the documentation from other websites and tools, including the most requested feature — tables! Just copy the table in its entirety in HTML, and it will show up inside Supernova, nice and formatted.

## Documentation page duplication

We've also added the option to duplicate documentation pages and pages contained inside a tab — ideal for creating templates that you want to be replicating across your entire site.

> Be warned:  
> It's not yet possible to duplicate entire groups and entire tabs. You can copy a single page of a tab and drop it to another tab, but you can't duplicate multiple at the same time. 

We're working on it but decided to split it into two releases to not keep you waiting at least with copying the single pages, which we know is already very much needed.

## New content menu tracking

We've *significantly improved the content menu and its tracking*. The content menu can now render 3 levels of headings (H1 was originally ignored), but it will also flawlessly track all the sections that are present on the page at once. This also creates a nice scrolling effect — explore it on this site yourself!
