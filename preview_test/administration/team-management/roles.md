# Roles

There are four roles in Supernova. By default, the person who creates the workspace is the Owner, who has full access to edit the workspace, design systems or team members. 

Here is a quick overview of each role in Supernova:

### Owner

The owner can edit any aspect of the workspace or design systems, can delete the workspace, and manage billing and accounts

### Admin

Admins can edit all aspects of the workspace, create new design systems for others to use, and manage billing and accounts

### Editor

Editors can participate in creation and editing of design system content, but are unable to change workspace or team settings

### Reviewer      

Reviewers can see and use design system content, but canâ€™t contribute new or edit existing design system data
